# Players-Database-Hattrick
This repository contains all files and programs for creating a normalized and relational database consisting of players from hattrick.org.
First, the data set is created in the Python program “Preparing_Database_hattrick”. This is later used by a sql script “Datenbankerstellung” to create the database. An overview of the design of this is in the file “Diagramm_DB_Design”.
